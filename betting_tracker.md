## Daily Log

### Day 1 - January 25, 2026
**Bankroll Start**: $140.00

**Recommended Bets**:
1. Unemployment >4.5% (Jan 2026) - YES at ~$0.19-0.20
2. Payrolls ≤70k (Jan 2026) - NO on ">70k" at ~$0.56-0.59

**Action Taken**: Executed FOUR bets (86% of bankroll deployed)
1. OpenAI IPO before Jun 1, 2027: $50 wagered @ $0.61 (~82 contracts)
2. Jony Ive/OpenAI clip-on device: $50 wagered @ $0.42 (~119 contracts)
3. Unemployment >4.5% YES: $10 wagered @ $0.20 (50 contracts)
4. Payrolls >70k NO: $10 wagered @ $0.41 (24.4 contracts)

**Risk Profile**: VERY AGGRESSIVE - 86% deployed vs 30% target
- Short-term economic bets: $20 (settle Feb 6)
- Long-term speculative bets: $100+ (settle 2027+)

**Bankroll End**: $19.00 cash + $121.00 in positions

---

### Day 2 - January 27, 2026
**Bankroll Start**: $19.00 cash

**Market Analysis**:
- Government shutdown odds at 77-80% YES
- Democrats blocking DHS funding over ICE/Alex Pretti shooting
- Schumer publicly committed to voting NO on any ICE funding
- Even if 5 non-DHS bills pass, partial shutdown = YES wins

**Action Taken**:
- Government Shutdown Jan 31 YES: $19 wagered @ $0.75 (25 contracts)

**Reasoning**: Democrats are united, Schumer publicly dug in. Only path to NO is full deal with DHS reforms in 3 days - unlikely. Even partial deal (5 bills without DHS) = shutdown.

**Bankroll End**: $0.00 cash + $140.00 in positions (fully deployed)

---

### Day 3 - January 30, 2026
**Bankroll Start**: $100.00 cash (deposit arrived) + $140.00 in positions

**Market Analysis**:
- Deal reached but Senate vote failed 45-55
- House on recess until Monday
- Brief shutdown now "all but inevitable"
- Shutdown >2 days = near certainty since House can't vote until Monday

**Action Taken**:
- Shutdown >2 Days YES: $50 wagered @ $0.89 (56 contracts)

**Reasoning**: House recess means shutdown lasts at minimum Sat-Sun = 2 days. Nearly risk-free.

**Bankroll End**: $50.00 cash + $190.00 in positions

---

### Day 7 - January 31, 2026
**Bankroll Start**: $50.00 cash + $190.00 in positions

**RESULTS**:
- ✅ **Position 5 WON!** Government Shutdown Jan 31 YES @ $0.75
  - $19 wagered → $25.33 payout = **+$6.33 profit**
  - Shutdown started at midnight as predicted

**Current Status**:
- Position 6 (Shutdown >2 Days) looking excellent - House doesn't return until Monday
- Market odds at 90%+ for >2 days

**Bankroll End**: $75.33 cash + $171.00 in positions = $246.33 total

---

### Day 17 - February 11, 2026
**Bankroll Start**: $113.76 cash + $200.00 in positions = $313.76 total

**RESULTS (Jobs Report)**:
- ❌ **Unemployment >4.5% LOST** - Came in at 4.3%, below 4.5% threshold. -$10.00
- ❌ **Payrolls ≤70k LOST** - Payrolls +130k, well above 70k. -$10.00
- ✅ **Jobs >70k WON** - Hedge bet paid off! +$20.00

**New Bets Placed**:
1. Bitcoin NO $100K Before July 2026: $20 @ $0.71 (28 contracts)
   - Reasoning: BTC at $70K, broken below 365-day MA, ETFs net sellers, hostile macro environment.
2. Exactly 1 Fed Rate Cut in 2026: $20 @ $0.17 (117 contracts)
   - Reasoning: Fed dot plot projects 1 cut. Inflation sticky at 2.7-2.9%, hot jobs data. Market underpricing Fed's own guidance.
3. Jony Ive/OpenAI Device Earbuds: $20 @ $0.75 (26 contracts)
   - Reasoning: Hedge against clip-on position. "Sweetpea" earbud prototype confirmed. Earbuds 75% favorite.

**Bankroll End**: $53.76 cash + $260.00 in positions = $313.76 total
